# FlightFare

Hey folks, Welcome to another interesting project! In this project we are going learn about data preprocessing and implementing machine learning algorithm in training 
and testing dataset to build a model which can predict the prices of filghts.

Data perspective for building model : 

1. Read Data
2. Data Processing and cleaning
3. Summarizing data
4. Visualization
5. Deriving Insights from data
